# Data set description
If you download the dataset, you can see that several features will be used to classify the quality of wine, many of them are chemical, so we need to have a basic understanding of such chemicals.

 *volatile acidity :   Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.
 *fixed acidity :   Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
 *residual sugar :   Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
 *citric acid :    It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.
 *chlorides :   Amount of salt present in wine.
 *free sulfur dioxide :   So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
 *total sulfur dioxide 
 *pH :   In wine pH is used for checking acidity
 *density 
 *sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
 *alcohol :   Percent of alcohol present in wine.

# Motive of project
  To analyze the data of the wine samples by acquiring,cleaning and visualize the data to find insights that can help detect whetther it is good or bad. the wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavor, and color, but we are not a wine expert to say that wine is good or bad.  Hereâ€™s the use of Machine Learning comes, yes  we are using machine learning to check wine quality. ML models, that are used for modeling is sample model ,random model and random forest.
